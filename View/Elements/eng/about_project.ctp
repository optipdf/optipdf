An advanced Pdf-optimization is a task, that you can't do after a short googeling. Even if you get used to the needed tools, you face the lack of technical resources and money consuming task. 
Our aim is to use only OpenSource-Tools on a server-queue, that will do a great job in Pdf-Optimization. The produced Pdfs will not only be cuttet per page, but re-rendered and compiled by state-of the art techniques.
Our main goal is to produce so called sandwich-pdfs that contain a layer of recognized text, one with raw image text and, if it exists, a layer containing graphical data (like illustrations or pictures).
With this techniques we're able to produce nearly losslessy compressed, searchable Pdfs that are an improvement in storage and usablity.
